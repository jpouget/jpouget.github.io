The Pouget Lab is a computational (dry) lab that leverages large-scale human genetic studies and multiomic sequencing technologies to understand how the brain works at a molecular level. We use these insights to shed light on the neurobiology of psychosis and related disorders. The ultimate goal of our research is to translate molecular discoveries into earlier, more personalized interventions and prevention strategies for young people experiencing mental illness.

We are actively recruiting graduate students, postdoctoral research fellows, and research analysts to join our group.

We are deeply committed to building a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive lab environment where every member feels safe, respected, and empowered to thrive. All lab members uphold a shared commitment to maintaining a culture of respect, accountability, and integrity in how we do science and support one another. 

Our team brings together people who are curious, kind, and highly motivated to advance our understanding of psychiatric disorders using multimodal genomic data. Experience in programming, computational biology, genomics, and/or biostatistics research, including analysis of sequencing data, are assets but above all we value creativity, collaboration, and a passion for discovery.

If this sounds like you, please email your application to Dr. Jennie Pouget (jennie.pouget@camh.ca) with subject line “Postdoctoral Fellow Application – Pouget Lab” and include the following in your application as a single PDF file:
1.	Cover letter (career background, research interests/training goals, preferred start date)
2.	CV
3.	1-2 representative papers or preprints
4.	Contact information for 3 professional references
