# Pouget Lab

The Pouget Lab uses cutting-edge computational genomics to uncover how genetic variation shapes brain development and vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. By integrating multiomic data from the brain, our team aims to pinpoint the molecular mechanisms underlying psychosis and translate these discoveries into earlier, more personalized interventions for youth mental health.

We are based in Toronto at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Canada's largest mental health teaching hospital and one of the world's leading research centres in its field.  CAMH is a fully affiliated teaching hospital and research institute of the University of Toronto.

We are actively recruiting graduate students, postdoctoral research fellows, and research analysts to join our group.

We are deeply committed to building a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive lab environment where every member feels safe, respected, and empowered to thrive. All lab members uphold a shared commitment to maintaining a culture of respect, accountability, and integrity in how we do science and support one another. 

Our team brings together people who are curious, kind, and highly motivated to advance our understanding of psychiatric disorders using multimodal genomic data. Experience in programming, computational biology, genomics, and/or biostatistics research, including analysis of sequencing data, are assets but above all we value creativity, collaboration, and a passion for discovery.

If this sounds like you, please email your application to Dr. Jennie Pouget (jennie.pouget@camh.ca) with subject line “Joining the Pouget Lab” and include the following in your application as a single PDF file:
1.	Cover letter (career background, research interests/training goals, preferred start date)
2.	CV
3.	1-2 representative papers or preprints
4.	Contact information for 3 professional references
